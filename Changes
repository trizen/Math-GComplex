Revision history for Math-GComplex

0.05    2018-01-06

        - Fixed the `floor()` and `ceil()` functions for integer arguments.
        - Make sure `Math::AnyNum >= 0.20` is installed. Otherwise skip the `t/anynum.t` test. (thanks to Slaven ReziÄ‡ for reporting this issue)

0.04    2018-01-05

        - Fixed the result of the `atan2(x, y)` function, when `x` and `y` are non-positive numbers.

0.03    2018-01-03

        - Added more examples.
        - Added subroutine prototypes.
        - Division by zero is now handled for native Perl numbers as components of complex numbers.
        - Binary numbers are no longer overloaded (such as: `0b101`, `0xff` or `012`).
        - Documented the syntax for disabling the `:overload` behavior.
